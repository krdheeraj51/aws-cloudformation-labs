# Lab 4: Using Mappings and Conditions

## Objective

Understand mappings and conditions to handle environment-specific configurations.

## Prerequisites

Completion of [Lab 3](../Lab3_Parameters_and_Outputs/README.md)

## Steps

1. Add a mapping for regions to AMI IDs in the template.
2. Introduce conditions to create specific resources (e.g., create an EC2 instance only in the `us-east-1` region).
3. Deploy the stack in multiple regions and observe behavior.
